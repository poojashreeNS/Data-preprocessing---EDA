# ASSIGNMENT - 01
## Question : 
- Pick a kaggle data set which might be fairly noisy
- write a data cleaning and preprocessing  and visualization colab using any data set
- you can do model training with scikit learn as well but we will not check the accuracy/performance of the model. the main focus is whether you did the right data cleaning

## Solution
Dataset - Movies Dataset For Feature Extraction ,Prediction
Prediction - Using Cosine Similarity 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning
    Using Pandas Library

- Handling missing values in the data using imputation.
- Identifying and removing duplicated in the data.
- Removing formatting in the data and getting them to a standard format.

### Data Visualization
    Using matplotlib Library

- Analysed different features by ploting graphically.
 
### Modelling
    Using sklearn Library

- Built the model using cosine similarity to predict similar movies.

### GitHub Files

This folder contains solution that is explained above along with the dataset.
